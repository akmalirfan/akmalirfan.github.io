        <h3><a href="waktusolat">Waktu Solat</a></h3>
        <p class="small">
            This project was started when e-Solat was still not mobile-friendly. Now, their website has improved.
            In this web app, the time for each prayer is displayed on a timeline. This makes it easy to visualize, for example,
            how much time do we have before the next prayer so that we can prepare ourselves for it. On supported mobile
            browser, this web app can be added to the home screen for better experience.

        <h3><a href="fuelprices">Fuel Prices</a></h3>
        <p class="small">
            This small web app is currently broken right now and I have no intention to fix it currently.
	    It is because I refuel my vehicles using cards nowadays and it is easy to set the fuel amount from the terminal.
            Its purpose was to show the user the exact price to be paid for the amount of fuel set by the user.

	    A lighter version of <a href="http://prpm.dbp.gov.my/">PRPM</a>. Currently, it only returns results
	    from Kamus Dewan.
